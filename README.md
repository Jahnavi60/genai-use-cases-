# Generative AI Use Cases with Python

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates four practical use cases of Generative AI. These examples highlight how large language models, image generators, and translation models can be used to build real-world AI applications.

# Overview

The notebook `genai.ipynb` includes hands-on examples and implementations for the following four key use cases:

# 1. Text Generation
This use case involves generating human-like text based on prompts using large language models.
*Applications:*
- Automated content creation
- Blog and story writing
- Email and document drafting
*Technologies Used:*
- OpenAI GPT models
- Prompt engineering
- Python `transformers` library

# 2. Image Generation
This section uses generative models to create images from text prompts, showcasing the potential of AI in creative fields.
* Applications:*
- Digital artwork generation
- Visual storytelling
- Design prototyping
*Technologies Used:*
- Diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion)
- Hugging Face `diffusers` library

# 3. Chatbot Assistant
Builds a conversational chatbot using language models to demonstrate natural language understanding and response generation.
*Applications:*
- Customer service bots
- Virtual assistants
- Knowledge-based Q&A systems
*Technologies Used:*
- LangChain framework
- OpenAI API
- Prompt templates

# 4. Language Translation & Detection
Implements translation and language detection using `googletrans`, enabling support for multilingual communication.
*Applications:*
- Real-time translation
- Cross-lingual document conversion
- Language identification
*Technologies Used:*
- `googletrans` Python package
- Language code mapping
